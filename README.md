# Sympa internship

To build all the pdf files, just run `make`, `make all` or `make pdf`.
You will need to have `pandoc` installed on your machine.

## DIARY

To build the pdf, just run `make diary`.

I've written in the diary what I did week for week (in French) during 
my six weeks internship.

## Documentation

### Apache James

To build the pdf, run `make james`. It will create the `doc_james.pdf` 
file. You can also read directly what it on the `docs/james/` folder.

This documentation will present you quickly what is James, and how to get 
started and setup in a easy way using `docker-compose` to have a 
playground for JMAP.

### JMAP

To build the pdf, run `make jmap`. It will create the `doc_jmap.pdf` 
file. You can also read directly what it on the `docs/jmap/` folder.

This documentation will explain you the authentication part for JMAP and 
give you the ressources you need to query what you want.
